# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction using Artificial Neural Network

This project predicts the **final academic performance (G3 score)** of students using a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.  
The dataset includes features such as school, gender, age, study time, past failures, and previous grades (G1, G2).  
A **Streamlit web application** is used for user-friendly predictions.

## 📌 Project Objective
The main goal is to develop a machine learning model that can **predict a student's final grade** based on given attributes,  
and deploy it using **Streamlit** for real-time prediction.
